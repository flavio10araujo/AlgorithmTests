/**
 * The Umbristan Department of Forestry(UDF) is tackling a rather difficult problem and the Umbristan government 
 * has detached you one of its best workers to go resolve the issue. 
 * When you arrive you are quickly briefed on the problem at hand. 
 * Inside the Umbristan National Park there exists an area that has been closed off as fencing needs to be erected in the area. 
 * The department for whatever reason needs to set up some very expensive fencing between the trees. 
 * The department has also set up some rules for the fence:
 * 1 - The fence needs to be set up such that every tree in the area is connected to the fence.
 * 2 - The department is on a very strict operating budget and so needs to minimize the metres of fencing required.
 * 3 - The department has counted the number of trees in the area 
 * 	   as well as determined all possible tree pairs where a fence can be built between the pair.
 * 
 * Can you help them figure out the smallest amount of fencing required?
 * It is possible that not all the nodes will be connected to one another depending on the tree pairs. 
 * Input will consist of trees the number of trees in the area labelled from 1 to n as well as pairs, 
 * a list consisting of the tuple [a, b, d] which denotes that a fence can be built between the trees a and b that will be d metres in length.
 * 
 * Constraints: 1 <= trees <= 10^5
 * 
 * Input: trees = 5, pairs = [[1, 2, 1], [2, 4, 2], [3, 5, 3], [4, 4, 4]]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: We can erect fencing between trees for the following pairs, 1 and 2, 2 and 4, 3 and 5. 
 * 			    With this every tree is connected by a fence and we have used 6 metres of fencing.
 * 
 * Solution:
 * 
 * The main idea is to run Kruskal's algorithm with some tweaked aspects. 
 * Instead of terminating when n - 1 nodes have been merged we are notified that it may not be possible to merge every node. 
 * Therefore, we simply just let the algorithm run until every edge is checked. 
 * One can also run prim's but make sure that every single node is calculated. 
 * Every connected component needs to have prim's algorithm run on it.
