/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/
 * 
 * You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck. 
 * 
 * You are given a 2D array boxTypes, where boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]:
 * - numberOfBoxesi is the number of boxes of type i.
 * - numberOfUnitsPerBoxi is the number of units in each box of the type i.
 * 
 * You are also given an integer truckSize, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck. 
 * You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed truckSize.
 * 
 * Return the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: boxTypes = { {2, 2}, {1, 3}, {3, 1} }, truckSize = 4
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: There are:
 * 	- 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
 * 	- 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
 *  - 1 box of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
 *  You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
 *  The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.
 *  
 *  Example 2:
 *  Input: boxTypes = {{5,10},{2,5},{4,7},{3,9}}, truckSize = 10
 *  Output: 91
 *  
 *  Constraints:
 *  1 <= boxTypes.length <= 1000
 *  1 <= numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi <= 1000
 *  1 <= truckSize <= 106
 *  
 *  Solution:
 *  
 *  Greedy Algorithm.
 *  The problem is fairly straightforward. 
 *  We simply sort the boxes by the number of units a box can contain and fill the truck until it's full.
