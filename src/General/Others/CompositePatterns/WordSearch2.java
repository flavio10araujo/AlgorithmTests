 * 
 * Word Search II | Depth First Search + Trie
 * 
 * For this question we ask you to determine if it is possible to make certain words given a 2-d matrix of characters. 
 * What we mean is that you will be given a 2-d grid of characters as well as a list of words. 
 * You may start at any point on the grid and move from cell to cell without looping back to a cell already travelled through 
 * and see if it is possible to make every word in the list of words. 
 * Output all possible words that can be created in the EXACT order that they appear in the list. 
 * The input for the matrix will appear as a list of words to represent the matrix.
 * 
 * Input
 * matrix: list of strings representing the 2-d matrix of characters
 * words: list of words to check if they can be made.
 * Output: list of all possible words that can be made.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 		matrix = [aab, aaa]
 * 		words = [bb, aa, abaa]
 * Output: [aa, abaa]
 * Explanation: We can easily make aa by starting at any of the cells containing a in the matrix then moving to another cell containing a. 
 * We cannot make bb as once we start at the 1 b position there is no other b to move onto to make bb.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= (row of matrix) * (column of matrix) <= 100
 * Each character will be a lower case english letter
 * 1 <= words.length <= 30001
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
 * 
 * Solution
 * 
 * For the question we need to use two of the patterns we have learned - DFS and Trie.
 * Firstly, we want to know whether or not we have correctly made a word. 
 * For this we first insert all the possible words into a trie.
 * As we dfs through the grid to make the possibilities we move down the trie at the same time. 
 * Once we reach a point where the next character does not exist in that particular node's child in the trie 
 * then we know no word in our list of words matches that sequence of characters. 
 * We therefore do not search any more cells in the grid as we know that no children contain that particular word. 
 * We also make sure to carefully mark which nodes in the trie we have reached.
 * We then repeat this process for every cell in the grid to check if it is possible to make a word. 
 * By the end we query every word in our trie to figure out which words we can make. 
 * Another minor implementation detail is that we need to make sure not to go back on cells we have visited. 
 * Therefore, we need to maintain a visited array that keeps marks cells that we reached and we unmark cells that we have not visited. 
 * It can also be noted that the character a has an ascii code of 97.
