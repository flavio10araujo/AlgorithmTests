/**
 * We have an array and a sliding window defined by a start index and an end index. 
 * The sliding window moves from left of the array to right. 
 * There are always k elements in the window. 
 * The window moves one position at a time. 
 * Find the maximum integer within the window each time it moves.
 * 
 * Input:
 * arr = [1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 7]
 * k = 3
 * Output: [3, 5, 8, 8]
 * 
 * 
 * Solution
 * 
 * Brute force
 * 
 * We can write a nested loop, the outer loop goes through each window and the inner loop finds the max within the window. 
 * This is O(N^2) time complexity.
 * To optimize on brute force, we can either reduce outer or inner loop complexity. 
 * Since we have to examine each element at least once (there's no way to find the maximum if we don't know what the values are..), 
 * there is not much we can do for outer loop. 
 * So we have to work on the inner loop.
 * 
 * Preserving inner elements maximum
 * 
 * Currently, to get the max of the sliding window, we look at each element in the window and compare them. 
 * Analogous to sliding window sum problem (given an array and a window size, return the sum of each window), 
 * when a window slides, only two elements change - the leftmost gets removed and a new element gets added to the right. 
 * Everything in the middle (let's call them "inner elements") is unchanged, 
 * and the maximum element among these inner elements are unchanged as well. 
 * The key to reducing inner loop complexity is to persist the maximum of the inner elements as we slide the window. 
 * Ideally, we want to be able to access the maximum element in less than O(N) time and updating it in less than O(N) time.
 * 
 * Balanced binary search tree
 * 
 * One way to achieve this goal is to save the window elements in a self-balancing binary search tree. 
 * Because it's self-balancing, the depth of the tree is guaranteed to be O(log(N)) so lookup, 
 * getting max, insert and delete are all O(log(N)) operations. 
 * Every time we slide the window, we remove the node that's out of the window and add the one that comes into the window to the tree. 
 * Overall, this gives us O(N log(k)) since the number of tree nodes is k and we slide max N times.
 * This is pretty good already, but can we do better?
 * 
 * Larger elements entering window invalidates smaller elements
 * 
 * A question we can ask ourselves is "do we need to keep all the window elements in our state?". 
 * An important observation is for two elements arr[left] and arr[right], where left < right, arr[left] leaves the window earlier as we slide. 
 * If arr[right] is larger than arr[left], then there is no point keeping arr[left] in our state since arr[right] is always gonna be larger 
 * during the time arr[left] is in the window. 
 * Therefore, arr[left] can never be the maximum.
 * 
 * Monotonic deque
 * 
 * Here we introduce an interesting data structure. 
 * It's a deque with an interesting property - the elements in the deque from head to tail are in decreasing order (hence the name monotonic).
 * To achieve this property, we modify the push operation so that 
 * when we push an element into the deque, we first pop everything smaller than it out of the deque.
 * This enforces the decreasing order.
 * 
 * The time complexity is O(N). 
 * This is because each element in the original array can only be pushed into and popped out of the deque once.
 * The key why monotonic deque works is it stores both magnitude and position information. 
 * From head to tail, the elements get smaller and further to the right of the array.
