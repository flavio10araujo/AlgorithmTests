/**
 * You work on a team whose job is to understand the most sought after toys for the holiday season. 
 * A teammate of yours has built a web crawler that extracts a list of quotes about toys from different articles. 
 * You need to take these quotes and identify which toys are mentioned most frequently. 
 * Write an algorithm that identifies the top N toys out of a list of quotes and a list of toys.
 * Your algorithm should output the top N toys mentioned most frequently in the quotes.
 *
 * Input
 * The input consists of five arguments:
 * 	numToys: an integer representing the number of toys.
 * 	topToys: an integer representing the number of top toys your algorithm needs to return.
 * 	toys: a list of strings representing the toys.
 * 	numQuotes: an integer representing the number of quotes about toys.
 * 	quotes: a list of strings that consists of space-separated words representing articles about toys.
 * 
 * Output
 * Return a list of strings of the most popular N toys in order of most to least frequently mentioned.
 * 
 * Note
 * The comparison of strings is case-insensitive. 
 * If the value of topToys is more than the number of toys, return the names of only the toys mentioned in the quotes. 
 * If toys are mentioned an equal number of times in quotes, sort by the count of quotes.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input:
 *   numToys = 6; topToys = 2; toys = ["elmo", "elsa", "legos", "drone", "tablet", "warcraft"]; numQuotes = 6
 *   quotes = [
 *   	"Elmo is the hottest of the season! Elmo will be on every kid's wishlist!",
 *      "The new Elmo dolls are super high quality",
 *      "Expect the Elsa dolls to be very popular this year, Elsa!",
 *      "Elsa and Elmo are the toys I'll be buying for my kids, Elsa is good",
 *      "For parents of older kids, look into buying them a drone",
 *      "Warcraft is slowly rising in popularity ahead of the holiday season"
 *   ]
 * Output: ["elmo", "elsa"]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * elmo - 4; elsa - 4
 * "elmo" should be placed before "elsa" in the result because "elmo" appears in 3 different quotes and "elsa" appears in 2 different quotes.
